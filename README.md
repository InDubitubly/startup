### Test for GitHub Assignment

I first of all learned that I had Visual Studio and not VS Code. So I learned the most about how to use VS Code. I also learned the order of the merge resolver, which explains why the '!' came before the 's' in my resolution.


## Product Pitch!

When I was younger, we had a Discord bot that would take a picture and a command and return an edited, funnier picture. The bot has been shut down for ages, but I want to revive the service with my website. My website will be easy to use and feature plenty of funny ways to edit photos without any of the effort. It will be the most convenient meme creator out there.

###### Notes from starting a server
ip - 52.15.102.216
how to ssh - ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
I went into someone else's computer for the first time. Felt a little something. That's all. Still so much I don't know.

###### Notes from naming an IP
Feels a lot cooler, I've now got a website with a url. A lot easier to understand too.
